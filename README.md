# Project Title:  Sorting algorithms & Big O

- What do you mean by sorting algorithm?

A sorting algorithm is a method for reorganizing a large number of items into a specific order, such as alphabetical, highest-to-lowest value or shortest-to-longest distance. Sorting algorithms take lists of items as input data, perform specific operations on those lists and deliver ordered arrays as output. In C programming language, there are multiple sorting algorithms available, which can be incorporated inside the code. The various types of sorting methods possible in the C language are Bubble sort, Selection sort, Quick sort, Merge sort, Heap sort and Insertion sort.

# Resources
# Read or watch:

- Sorting algorithm
- Big O notation
- Sorting algorithms animations
- 15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes (WARNING: The following video can trigger seizure/epilepsy. It is not required for the project, as it is only a funny visualization of different sorting algorithms)

# Learning Objectives
*At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:*

# General
- At least four different sorting algorithms
- What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- What is a stable sorting algorithm
